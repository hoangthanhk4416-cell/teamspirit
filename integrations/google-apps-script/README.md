# TEAMSPIRIT order intake

This Apps Script receives checkout payloads from the static GitHub Pages website and appends them to the TEAMSPIRIT Google Sheet.

## One-time deployment

1. Open the destination Google Sheet.
2. Select **Extensions → Apps Script**.
3. Replace the editor contents with `Code.gs`.
4. Select **Deploy → New deployment → Web app**.
5. Execute as: **Me**. Who has access: **Anyone**.
6. Authorize the script and copy the `/exec` deployment URL.
7. Paste that URL into `assets/order-config.js` as `endpoint`.

Do not place Google credentials or API keys in the website repository.

## Apply or repair the spreadsheet layout

After pasting a new `Code.gs` version:

1. Select `setupOrderSheets` in the function menu.
2. Click **Run** and approve the requested spreadsheet/trigger permissions.
3. The function repairs headers and dropdowns, normalizes legacy design values, and installs the edit trigger that keeps order status synchronized between `Đơn hàng` and `Chi tiết sản phẩm`.

The same setup also creates `Tra cứu vận đơn`, a Korean-language customer tracking tab. Column `고객 안내 메시지 (직접 입력)` is reserved for staff-written customer notices and is preserved when order status changes. The public lookup page reads only this tracking tab and never exposes the internal Vietnamese management columns.
